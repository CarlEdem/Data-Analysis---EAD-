COPD Hospitalizations in Minnesota, Related to Air Quality

## The Problem & Approach
The prevalence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Minnesota, while lower than the national average, persists among 4.5% of the population. Furthermore, there are regional differences in the effect of air quality on hospitalization and mortality from COPD. Using the division of Minnesota counties as the geospatial unit, and the annual reporting of Minnesota populations, we will cultivate a dataset that could investigate the association between COPD hospitalization/mortality and air quality (both time series components) based on data of COPD hospitalizations provided by the Minnesota Department of Health from 2006 to 2017. We aim to curate a singular dataset that could analyze patterns between the presence of fine particle concentrations (a risk factor) and COPD hospitalizations.

The final dataset not only includes information about the count of COPD hospitalizations by county, by year, but also joins the dataset to air quality information (level of PM 2.5 particles in the air) by county and by year. In addition, we supplemented the COPD and air quality data with Minnesota geospatial data (county geospatial information) as well as Minnesota county population and household data. New features were generated to enhance the dataset, such as a feature to describe missing values in the COPD hospitalization dataset, features that converted area and perimeter of counties in meters to miles, centroid for each county, the number of people per square mile by county, the percent of people hospitalized for COPD (based on county and population), and the air quality categorization based on the concentration of PM 2.5 particles in the air.
